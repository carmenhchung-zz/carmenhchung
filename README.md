## 📖 My Story

I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts/Bachelor of Laws (with Honors) from the University of New South Wales, before working internationally as a corporate lawyer for seven years. In 2017, I discovered my passion for coding after being awarded the Women in Tech Scholarship to study at Coder Academy in Sydney, Australia. I am currently working as a full stack Software Engineer (Node & Vue.js) at CompliSpace.

My mission is to work collaboratively with others to solve real-world problems with fresh, creative tech solutions that follow industry best practices.

## 🏆 Engagements & Awards

In 2020, I was selected as a Finalist in the Rising Technologist category of the Booking.com Technology Playmaker Awards.

I am a big believer in sharing knowledge about engineering, product and design. I regularly write published blog posts, and have spoken at a number of large-scale tech conferences, including ReactAU (Sydney, 2020), RubyConf (Melbourne, 2020), APIDays (Melbourne, 2019), and DDDSydney (Sydney, 2019). In addition, I run a YouTube channel called Code Fights, where developers try to solve coding challenges within 15 minutes.

In my spare time, you can find me creating digital illustrations, reading fantasy novels, volunteering to build websites for charities through Vollie, teaching stretch classes, and fostering rescue dogs.

## 🗣 Testimonials

James Middlemiss, Senior Software Engineer:
> "Carmen and I had the pleasure of working together for a year and a half from January 2019. In that time we worked closely as a small engineering team on several small and large scale projects within the company, building internal tools and API's for public use. Carmen's work ethic, eagerness to learn and passion for technology is second to none, making her an ideal colleague. Friendly and professional, Carmen is delightful to work with, and I would not hesitate to make her a colleague of mine again." 

Joanne Harries, Founder of The Vet Equation:
> "Working with Carmen has been fantastic. Carmen is extremely efficient, responsive, enthusiastic and easy to work with. She takes the time listen to desired project outcomes and any specific requests, and clearly explains all of the steps of the project and analysis for different approaches, which is very useful. I am thrilled with the work Carmen has done so far and I give her my highest recommendation!"

Emily Ledger, Community Fundraising Coordinator at Cystic Fibrosis QLD:
> "I connected with Carmen on Vollie (virtual volunteering platform) and selected her to work with us at Cystic Fibrosis Queensland to help us build a new website for the charity. Carmen worked with us to understand our needs and content and created an extremely professional, user-friendly website that has been invaluable for us. It was an absolute pleasure working with Carmen, she made sure to keep us informed of her progress at all times, was friendly, professional, hard working and went above and beyond expectations."

Rosann Ling, Founder of Prism Creative:
> "Carmen has been an absolute dream to work with! Always coming in with excellent solutions to our UX problems and making sure the project runs smoothly. As a designer, I've found it particularly helpful working together with Carmen as she provides invaluable insight into how to create an excellent user experience while building a solid back-end framework."
